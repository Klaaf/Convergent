# Convergent
 
Convergent is a modpack focusing on exploration, adventure and building.

It aims not to stray too far from Vanilla Minecraft at its core, but offers plenty of features, as well as a revamped difficulty.

With less than 120 mods, Convergent is rather lightweight and it will remain that way, to be playable on most systems.
